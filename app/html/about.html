        <!--<p class="lead">I took a few programming classes while I was finishing my undergradate degree at UW.
        These classes inspired me to go to Codefellows and become a full-stack web developer</p>-->
        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p class="bio">I am full-stack software developer with a focus on JavaScript and predominately experienced in implementing MEAN stack web applications. My interest in software development was sparked as I was finishing my Anthropology degree at UW. I took a few intro CSE courses which ultimately led me to Codefellows to learn full-stack web development where I can utilize the skills I learned from Anthropology to build web apps that focus on ease of use and fluid user experiences for the app's specific audience.</p>
